WAS: thirdparty
===============

This folder should be used to keep all third party code and libraries that
support the project but are not a part of the source. Things like build helpers
and so forth.

NOTE: The scaffolding itself will download libraries here in order to prep and
run the development environment.

Also the default `.gitignore` is set to ignore everything in this folder
except this `readme.md`.
