/**
 * @fileoverview Typedefs for the application.
 *
 * Typedefs are structured definitions of complex Javascript objects that are
 * usually passed as parameters to methods. Defining these allows the linter
 * and compiler to do type checking parameters passed to methods that are not
 * primative types. Can be handy in preventing errors based on passing bad
 * parameters to a method. See:
 * https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler
