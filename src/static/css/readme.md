WAS: src/static/css
===============

Keep all application LESS and CSS files in this directory. Each of these files
should represent a target CSS file that will be used as the href in a link tag
in HTML; keep all other LESS files inside of `static/css/lib`. Files with a
`.less` or `.css` extension will be processed by the LESS compiler.
